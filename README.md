# Welcome to this tutorial on Code Coverage

This Demo has developed to show features and abilities of Code coverage tools In Real Projects.

## Code Coverage Criteria
- Function Coverage
  - The functions in the source code that are called and executed at least once.
- Statement Coverage
  - the number of statements that have been successfully validated in the source code.  
- Path Coverage
  - A sequence of controls and conditions that have worked well at least once.  
- Branch or Decision Coverage
  - The decision control structures like loop that have executed fine.
- Condition Coverage
  - The boolean expressions that are validated and that executes both TRUE and FALSE as per the test runs.  

## Why do we measure code coverage?
   1. to know how well our tests actually test our code
   2. to know whether we have enough testing in place
   3. to maintain the test quality over the lifecycle of the project
